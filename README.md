# MTG-Life-Counter-App
The purpose of this app is to facilitate the tracking of life totals as the current method used (pen and paper) is too slow thus it can sometimes influence heavily the outcome of the match.

For creating this app I used Java and XML in Android Studio. For checking the Java file please go to : https://github.com/Gfr0st/MTG-Life-Counter-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/mtglifecounter/MainActivity.java and for the XML file please go to: https://github.com/Gfr0st/MTG-Life-Counter-App/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
