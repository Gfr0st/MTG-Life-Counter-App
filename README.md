# MTG-Life-Counter-App
The purpose of this app is to facilitate the tracking of life totals as the current method used (pen and paper) is too slow thus it can sometimes influence heavily the outcome of the match.

For creating this app I used Java and XML in Android Studio. For checking the Java file please go to : https://github.com/Gfr0st/MTG-Life-Counter-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/mtglifecounter/MainActivity.java and for the XML file please go to: https://github.com/Gfr0st/MTG-Life-Counter-App/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml

A screenshot is posted below so you can check how it actually looks on a mobile device:

Some of the key features of this app include: 
- User can customize the name of the 2 players
- If a life total change would take too much time while pressing the buttons, the user can insert a custom number from the keyboard if he presses the life total number
